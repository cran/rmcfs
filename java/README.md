MCFS-ID (Monte Carlo Feature Selection and Interdependency Discovery) is a Monte Carlo method-based tool for feature selection. It also allows for the discovery of interdependencies between the relevant features. MCFS-ID is particularly suitable for the analysis of high-dimensional, 'small n large p' transactional and biological data.

Weka12 is a slightly modified Weka 3.6.10. All changes are necessary to work with Java implementation of MCFS-ID.
